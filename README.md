This project aims to be a website in which you can practice your rhythmic solfège through simple
one-beat rhythmic figures.  
  
# Overview  
Sight reading sheet music is a daunting task. Not only do you need to worry about key signatures, accidentals, chords, articulations, but also about rhythm! This project emerged as a result of my journey trying to be a better musician and wanting a good way to practice understanding the most common rhythmic figures. I was heavily inspired by [Saher Galt's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5_27Gc28ls&list=PLL_-wssODcBPiAtEQYgAMWLj2WJdMvYlm) on rhythm.  
Currently the site is in its barest-bones version possible, but I think it's quite enough to start practicing!

Tested on Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Firefox's audio is janky so it's not ideal to view through there.
