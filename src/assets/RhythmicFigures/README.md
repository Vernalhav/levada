# Rhythmic Figures!  
This is where the images for all music figures and their corresponding rhythm get stored. Feel free to check them out, but please **DON'T MAKE CHANGES DIRECTLY HERE!** Any changes that you would want to make here are probably automated in the [image generators directory](/image-generators). There you can  
- Add a new rhythmic figure  
- Edit an existing rhythmic figure  
- (TODO) Remove an existing rhythmic figure
